# Welcome to the new version of findtags!

When findtags first launched in 2020, it was written with jQuery. That  was a pretty outdated way of handling this, so I wanted to start over completely with React. 

This version has not been officially released on the findtags blog, but is open for feedback/testing before the official release. You can view updates here: [https://findtags.tumblr.com/tagged/findtags.blog](https://findtags.tumblr.com/tagged/findtags.blog)

## How to use: 
- Go to the live page and starts searching for the tag you are interested in. It should start pulling up the most recent posts using that tag! 
- You can view older posts by clicking the button at the bottom of the page. It should refresh the results. If no new results are showing, you are already on the last page!

## Current version:

- [x] Search function
